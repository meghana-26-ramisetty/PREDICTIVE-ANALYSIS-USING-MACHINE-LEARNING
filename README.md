"DESCRIPTION":  

This predictive analysis task was completed using Microsoft Excel with the help of Google as a learning and reference resource. The objective of the task was to build a machine learning–based predictive model, such as regression or classification, to predict outcomes using a given dataset. Although advanced machine learning models are commonly implemented using programming languages like Python or tools such as Scikit-learn, Excel can also be used effectively for basic predictive analysis, especially for understanding core concepts such as feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

The dataset was first collected from online sources using Google. Public datasets related to sales forecasting, student performance, or customer behavior were searched and downloaded in CSV or Excel format. Google played an important role in identifying suitable datasets and learning how to apply predictive techniques in Excel using built-in tools and formulas. After obtaining the dataset, it was imported into Excel, where all further processing and analysis were carried out.

The first step in predictive analysis was data preprocessing and cleaning. This involved removing duplicate entries, handling missing values, and correcting any incorrect or inconsistent data. Excel features such as filters, conditional formatting, and built-in functions like IF, ISBLANK, and COUNT were used to identify and clean the dataset. Unnecessary columns that did not contribute to prediction were removed to improve model accuracy and efficiency. This step ensured that the data used for training the model was reliable and of good quality.

Next, feature selection was performed. Feature selection means choosing the most relevant input variables that influence the output. In Excel, this was done by analyzing relationships between different columns and the target variable. Correlation analysis, descriptive statistics, and visual inspection using charts helped in identifying which features had a strong impact on the outcome. For example, in a sales prediction model, features such as price, quantity, discount, and region might be chosen, while irrelevant columns like ID numbers were excluded. Google was helpful in understanding how correlation and statistical relationships guide feature selection.

After selecting features, the dataset was divided into training and testing data. The training data was used to build the predictive model, while the testing data was used to evaluate its performance. In Excel, this was achieved by randomly splitting the dataset using functions like RAND() and sorting the data accordingly. Typically, 70% of the data was used for training and 30% for testing.

For model training, Excel’s built-in tools such as the Data Analysis ToolPak were used. For regression-based prediction, the Regression tool was applied to train a model that predicts a continuous value, such as sales or profit. For classification problems, logical formulas and threshold-based decision rules were used to categorize outcomes. The regression output provided coefficients, intercept values, and statistical measures that formed the predictive model. These coefficients were then used to calculate predicted values in a new column.

Model evaluation was carried out by comparing the predicted values with the actual values in the testing dataset. Metrics such as accuracy, error rate, and percentage error were calculated using Excel formulas. For regression models, measures like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were computed to understand how close the predictions were to the actual values. For classification tasks, a simple confusion matrix was created using COUNTIF functions to calculate accuracy and performance.

Visualization was also used to interpret the results. Scatter plots were created to compare actual vs. predicted values, and charts were used to show performance trends. These visual tools made it easier to understand the effectiveness of the model.

In conclusion, this predictive analysis task was successfully performed using Excel with the guidance of Google resources. The project demonstrated all the required steps: feature selection, model training, and evaluation. It showed how basic machine learning concepts can be implemented in Excel, making it a practical and educational approach for internship-level predictive analysis.
